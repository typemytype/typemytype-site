This small fontfamily was part of the research for my final project in Type & Media. My starting-point was to design a broad nib and pointed pen version, true to the calligraphic principles of these pens. They do not solve any technical problem. They are not intended for use in a specific size, but I drew them with a text type in mind. I started with sketching and afterwards I digitalized these drawings. The expansion and translation are tuned to each other. Visually, they have the same x-height and the same darkness in text.
