A workshop at [Ecal][ECAL] in Lausanne (22-26 october 2007), I gave with the assistance of Clement Gallet, to first and second year students of the Graphic Design Department. The workshop contains basic python and drawBot.

This evolved to the focus being on how to use python in search of graphical solutions. The students experimented with creating letters using scripting, leading to display letters. The goal was to experiment with constructed letters, build up with line segments and redifine what a line could be. What could the graphical solutions be when one goes from point A to point B.
