During a *semaine speciale* at the [Ecal][ECAL] in Lausanne (30 april â€“ 5 may 2009), I was invited to teach scripting in typedesign. I started with some basic python lessons in [drawbot](http://www.drawbot.com/) so the students could play with basic shapes applying scripts.

<!--more-->

The class was divided into two groups. The goal for the first group was to program an autoTypeGenerator. The script uses predefined basic elements to construct a whole alphabet. These basic elements have *magnetic points* inside, so they were able to connect smoothly. The output was a font with a lot of components. As a result, after using the script, it was easy to change the basic elements to end up with a completely different typeface.

The second group was more focused on design and scripting. They made a booklet which was completely built by a script. The program places text with style sheets and images.

After the workshop, I kept working on the idea of building a complete font out of some basic elements. The result is [FontConstructor](http://www.fontconstructor.com/).

Thanks to all the students *:)
