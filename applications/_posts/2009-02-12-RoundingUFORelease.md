RoundingUFO is a mac only application that converts the corners of the glyphs in your fonts according to user-defined parameters.

It automates the process yet lets you keep complete control as a designer. You determine the parameters: the black and the white corners. RoundingUFO doesn’t mess around with your contours; the necessary points are added.

With RoundingUFO considerably speeds up the production process, without loss of quality. All UFO‘s generated with roundingUFO can be interpolated.

Additional features include: adding ink traps or simply cutting off the corners instead of adding rounding them.
