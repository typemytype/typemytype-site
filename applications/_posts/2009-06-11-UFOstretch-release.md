UFOstretch is a standalone mac only application which allows you to transform, translate and interpolate a specific set of glyphs. It provides a range of measurement tools so a high level of accuracy can be obtained. All this can be done simultaneously and is immediately visually presented. The output can be added to one of the master files or be exported in a new UFO.
