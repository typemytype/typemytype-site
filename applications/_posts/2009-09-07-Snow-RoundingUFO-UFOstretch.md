There is an update for roundingUFO and UFOstretch

Snow Leopard users will be able to use the apps now!
Thanks to [Tal](http://www.typesupply.com/)

## [UFOstretch](http://ufostretch.typemytype.com/)

The only change is that it is now compatible with Snow Leopard.

## [RoundingUFO](http://roundingufo.typemytype.com/)

Added some display options. It should help you to set parameters better to your needs. Previewing the on curve and off curve points makes it easier to understand what is happening lower level.

You can save/store your parameters. This is handy but necessary if you want to batch generate. Just drag and drop your [UFO](http://unifiedfontobject.org/) family to round them all. Double click will open a roundingUFO window.
