In the range of [UFO](http://unifiedfontobject.org/) tools, available or under contractions, the main editor was still missing.That will change with this presentation.

[RoboFont](http://robofont.com/) is an interactive drawing board for fonts and glyphs. Entirely written in [Python](http://www.python.org/) and based on [Defcon](http://code.typesupply.com/wiki/defcon) and [Robofab](http://robofab.com/) (by [Tal Leming](http://typesupply.com/), [Erik van Blokland](http://letterror.com/) and [Just van Rossum](http://letterror.com/)) the editor allows full scripting access to objects and interface. The application is made for dynamic interaction with existing [UFO](http://unifiedfontobject.org/) applications.

Examples of additional tools and scripts will be shown as extensions to the application. The application is a project by Frederik Berlaen with support of [Petr van Blokland](http://www.petr.net/) and [David Berlow](http://www.fontbureau.com/).
