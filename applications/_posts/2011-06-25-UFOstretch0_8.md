One of the main requested features for [UFOstretch][US] is the ability to apply the stretch parameters to all glyphs in a font easily.

[UFOstretch][US] has now a new ‘Generate All’ toolbarbutton. Which is going to apply all parameters to the complete charset of the first master.

This request also solves an other issue: stretch components! [UFOstretch][US] doesn’t support components in a sub-stretch-set. The app decompose them before generating a stretched glyph cause the app cannot know if you added the baseglyph. The complexity is becoming higher when a user wanted to insert the stretch set in an existing UFO. So the ‘Generate All’ button supports components so al your components stay components.
