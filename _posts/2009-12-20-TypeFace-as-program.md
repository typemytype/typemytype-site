A publication by [Ecal][EC] about automated typedesign. Part of the process was initiated at a [workshop]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url teaching/2007-10-30-Workshop-Ecal1 %}) some years ago and by Ian Partyâ€™s final project at the [Ecal][EC].

Superbly designed by David Keshavjee & Julien Tavelli.
