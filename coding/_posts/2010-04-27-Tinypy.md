A new online tool for every python lover:

## [TinyPy](http://tinypy.appspot.com/)

How it works:

First of all a server with python is needed. The easiest was to create a [Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/). Next steps are fairly easy: send some ajax request with the python code to the server and execute it.

On the the server there is a drawing callback wrapper that generates javascript. The generate javascript is send back to the user and draws in the <canvas> html 5 object.

enjoy it!
